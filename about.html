      <h2 class="uh1">Our Work</h2>
      <p class="con">
        Our project is dedicated to helping first-year students understand the fundamentals of Web System Development. 
        We have created a learning platform that offers well-organized lessons structured around to the topics covered in the ITWS 
        (Information Technology Web System) course during the second semester. Each lesson is carefully written to ensure 
        clarity, engagement, and practical relevance, making it easier for students to grasp even the most technical concepts. 
        By focusing on accessibility and quality content, we aim to support learners in building a strong foundation in web development.

      <h2 class="uh1">Purpose and Vision</h2>
      <p class="con">
        The purpose of this project is to provide an effective educational resource that students can use at their own pace. 
        Whether someone is just starting to learn HTML, our platform is structured 
        to guide them through with clear explanations and structured lessons. We envision a platform that not only educates but also inspires students to explore and create using the knowledge they gain from our content.
